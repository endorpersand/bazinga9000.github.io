		<p>The entity rose from their seat halfway back and took their position at the lectern at the head of the chamber. This space was as infinite in dimension as its occupants were in ability and as menacing as those occupants wished it to be. Due to recent events, the menace level was unfortunately set to a resounding “very”. While this entity was one of them, they were not immune. They prepared themself as a voice spoke up.</p>

		<p>“Seventeen, we are now ready to hear your proposal."</p>

		<p>They gulped. Seventeen knew that their proposal was a bit odd, to say the least, and they feared it might earn them the ridicule of the entire Council. Considering that the last time a gaffe of this magnitude happened, Thirty Eight was dubbed “Bluehead” for about four thousand years, this was entirely unwanted. </p>

		<p>“Thank you, One. I’m not going to waste time going over the why here, we all already know that. My admittedly…” They stuttered for a bit. “Esoteric proposal might be a good way to find a solution. Or many, in fact. I propose that we hold a large race—”</p>

		<p>Immediately after that word was spoken, a drawn-out guffaw broke Seventeen’s speech.</p>

		<p>“A <i>race‽</i> Are you serious?” Eight began, barely stopping themself from breaking into laughter again. “You think we can just find some people, throw them on a track and then all of a sudden our problem is solved? This is serious, Seventeen! I knew you had the IQ of a slug but this is ridiculous!” </p>

		<p>Another voice, calmer and less blatantly aggressive, rose to counter. “Come on, Eight, let them speak. Besides, something only has to act like a race to be called one, we all know that. Even so, like you said, this is a serious problem. We need to consider any and all options we can, so this proposal is just as valid as any other.” </p>

		<p>Eight stammered for a few seconds and then clammed up.</p>

		<p>Seventeen was quite thankful for this save. After regaining some composure, they spoke again. “Thank you, Five. As I was saying before being interrupted, we hold a race. While the first leg would be something of a traditional race, as raw speed is something we need to find, I have other race-adjacent legs further into the contest. I have placed a document in the Master Archive detailing the rest of the race.”</p>

		<p>Nobody spoke for a few minutes as everyone examined the document. At first there were chuckles throughout the chamber, but those slowly turned into discussion within the assembly and eventually to murmurs of approval. Eventually, Two spoke up.</p>

		<p>“Not to inflate your ego, Seventeen, but this is brilliant. I have just one question though. How are we to ensure that those necessary are actually going to participate? We’d need to scour many worlds and draw them out.”</p>

		<p>A smile grew on Seventeen’s face as they revealed the answer. “That’s the best part, Two! We kill two birds with one stone and have a set of powerful artifacts as the prize. This means that the winners are proven competent! In addition, we can even use the lower placers and give them some consolation prizes.”</p>

		<p>“Elegant”, Two declared. At this Seventeen’s attempts at keeping their ego in check collapsed and they broke out into a dumb grin. “One, have you anything to say?”</p>

		<p>“I do not.” they announced. “After a quick read of the room this is merely a formality, but now we must cast our votes on this race proposal.” The sounds of buttons pressing and displays beeping filled the room. Even though they didn’t have to vote like this, they enjoyed this more traditional method. After the vote tally was complete One spoke once more. </p>

		<p>“By a vote of ninety to one, the proposal passes. Before we begin planning, you never actually gave this proposal a name, Seventeen. What do you want to call it?”</p>

		<p>Seventeen never actually thought about this while drafting the proposal, so this question put them on the spot a bit. After looking through their document for inspiration they realized that the route of the first leg looked like something. Inspiration struck, and Seventeen spoke:</p>

		<p>“The Horse Shoe Run.”</p>

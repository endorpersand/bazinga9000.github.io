Hello!

This is a series that will attempt to go through the field of Combinatorial Game Theory in depth, requiring as little mathematical background as possible. If you've watched the [Hackenbush video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYj4NkeGPdM), you know how deep this rabbit hole goes. This series will follow a similar path to that video, but will be more thorough.

That video and this series are both based on the four-volume series *Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays* by Conway, Berlekamp, and Guy. Readers among you who have already read these texts should still stick around, of course. In my time reading through that book, as amazing an introduction as it may be, I've felt at times that it went a bit fast. This series will try not to go too quick for its own good.

Another note for readers of *Winning Ways*: There are some bits of convention in that book that I'm ignoring because I don't like them. If you haven't read or don't want to read the books, you can safely skip over this bit. A list of such is as follows, and may be expanded as the series progresses:

* *Winning Ways* often expresses sums using concatenation, for example writing $\ast\uparrow$ to represent $\ast + \uparrow$. This series will not do that for clarity, always expressing sums using the plus sign.

* The distinction between the terms "game" and "position" in *Winning Ways* is very vague, as the books often use "game" to refer to a position within a game. In this series, the term "game" will exclusively refer to entire games, such as Hackenbush, whereas "position" will refer only to individual game states.

With that out of the way, let's get to it!
